        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>While you may see this dish frequently at American Chinese restaurants, it is actually<br>
            a true Cantonese dish. This is the Americanized version that will duplicate, what you're used<br>
            to eating for take-out. You can substitute sherry and soy sauce for the white wine to make <br>
            a version with brown sauce.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/4 pound sliced fresh mushroom</li>
            <li>1/4 pound snow peas</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 pound sliced bok choy</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>3/4 cup skinless, boneless chicken breast - thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tea spoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
            <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat.<br>
                Stir in the mushrooms, snow peas, water chestnuts, and bak choy; season to taste<br>
                with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes.<br>
                Remove the vegetables from the wok and wipe the wok clean</p>
            <strong><li>Step</li></strong>
            <p>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the wok. Stir in the garlic<br>
                 and ginger; cook a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn golden brown.<br>
            Stir in the chicken and cook until the chicken is no longer pink, about  minutes.<br>
            Add the wine, sugar and chicken broth; bring to a boil. Dissolve the cornstarch in<br>
            the water and stir into the simmering sauce. Once the sauce returns to a simmer, stir<br>
        until thick and clean, about 30 seconds. Return the vegetables to the wok and toss until <br>
        hot and coated with the sauce.</p>
        </ol>
